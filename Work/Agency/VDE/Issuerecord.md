# VDE 

## Qustion 1

```
Hi Anushaï¼Œ

We are just aware of an issue and are not sure how to handle it, need your help to check and advise.
1.	We provide the PCBA BOM to suppliers WA and Civlux.
2.	The supplier WA and CV build the PCBA per the BOM.
3.	For some of the components, there are many different components listed as equivalent, and the supplier thinks they can choose any one of them if they are equivalent.
4.	But not each equivalent component is listed in the VDE checklist.
5.	It will cause the problem that, the PCBA meets the BOM, but does not meet the VDE checklist, how to handle it?
6.	If the PCBA must follow the VDE checklist, we should start an ECR to remove the equivalent component from the BOM, otherwise, we have no way to make sure the supplier will always choose the VDE-listed components.
7.	If we do not change the BOM, that means we will need to add all equivalent components to the VDE list. Which way we should go?

Attached list shows many items are NG (see red font) and those PCBAs are completed. How to handle it?

Regarding the new VDE check process, I think per the process, the WA and CA need to send you the check list to review and approval each time they build the PCBA, and until you approval, they can then allow to build it, is that correct? The supplier they are not notified to follow this rule, and they think they should not contact you directly, and need to check with our purchasing, and we (Jiaxing purchasing) to check with you to get the checked list reviewed and approved, then notify them to proceed? If this the correct way to go?
