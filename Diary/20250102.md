Since I sleep very early last night, so in the morning, I weak up very early, around 3:00 am, and stay in the bed till 5, and getup and take a shawer, and then go to office. On the way to the office, the sky still dark, and little people on the road, but do see many cars. Llooks like the busy people still working for some reason, and i'm not the only one in work.

The new year is a new start for me. I hope to enjoy the time that I still have.
