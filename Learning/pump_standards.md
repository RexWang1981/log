## ISO 5199: Technical Specifications for Centrifugal Pumps for Industrial Applications

This standard defines the requirements for the design and construction of centrifugal pumps used in industrial processes. It covers aspects like mechanical construction, vibration limits, and performance characteristics, ensuring reliability and long service life.

## ISO 2858: End-Suction Centrifugal Pumps – Designation, Nominal Duty, and Dimensions

This standard specifies the dimensions and designation of single-stage, end-suction centrifugal pumps. It ensures uniformity in pump dimensions, facilitating interchangeability of pumps from different manufacturers.

## ISO 9906: Rotodynamic Pumps – Hydraulic Performance Acceptance Tests

This standard outlines the methods for conducting hydraulic performance tests on centrifugal pumps. It defines the acceptance criteria for testing to ensure pumps meet the specified performance levels for flow rate, head, and efficiency.

## ISO 13709 (API 610): Centrifugal Pumps for Petroleum, Petrochemical, and Natural Gas Industries

ISO 13709 (also aligned with API 610) specifies the minimum requirements for centrifugal pumps used in heavy-duty services like refineries and chemical plants. It covers design features that improve reliability and maintainability in these critical applications.


## ISO 10816: Mechanical Vibration – Evaluation of Machine Vibration by Measurements on Non-Rotating Parts

This standard provides guidelines for assessing vibration levels in rotating machines, including centrifugal pumps. It sets limits for acceptable vibration levels to ensure smooth operation and prevent mechanical failures.

## API 610: Centrifugal Pumps for Petroleum, Petrochemical, and Natural Gas Industries

API 610 is one of the most widely referenced standards for centrifugal pumps used in the oil and gas industries. It provides guidelines for pump design, construction, materials, and testing to ensure high reliability, especially in harsh operating conditions. It also covers aspects like mechanical seals, bearing arrangements, and API material specifications.

## API 682: Pumps – Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps

This standard specifies the requirements for mechanical seal systems used in centrifugal pumps in the petroleum, petrochemical, and natural gas industries. It addresses seal design, testing, and performance to ensure leak prevention and long service life in challenging environments.

## API 685: Sealless Centrifugal Pumps for Petroleum, Heavy Duty Chemical, and Gas Industry Services

This standard focuses on magnetic drive and canned motor sealless centrifugal pumps used in hazardous environments where conventional mechanical seals may not be suitable.

The Hydraulic Institute (HI) publishes standards in the U.S. for the design, operation, and testing of pumps. These ANSI/HI standards are widely used in North America:

## ANSI/HI 9.6.3: Rotodynamic Pumps – Guidelines for Allowable Nozzle Loads

This standard defines the permissible forces and moments acting on pump nozzles to avoid excessive mechanical stress on the pump casing and piping, preventing misalignment and premature failure.

## ANSI/HI 9.6.4: Rotodynamic Pumps – Vibration Measurement and Allowable Values

This standard provides guidelines for measuring and evaluating vibration levels in centrifugal pumps. Acceptable vibration limits are specified to ensure smooth and reliable operation, minimizing wear and tear on pump components.

## ANSI/HI 9.8: Pump Intake Design

This standard outlines best practices for designing pump intakes to avoid issues like cavitation, recirculation, and vortex formation that can negatively affect pump performance.

## NSI/HI 1.3: Rotodynamic (Centrifugal) Pumps for Design and Application

This standard provides detailed guidelines for the design, application, and operation of centrifugal pumps. It covers topics like system requirements, pump selection, and operational efficiency.

## ASME B73.1: Specification for Horizontal End-Suction Centrifugal Pumps for Chemical Process

This standard is commonly used in the chemical industry and specifies the design, dimensions, and performance criteria for horizontal, end-suction centrifugal pumps.

## ASME B31.3: Process Piping

While not directly a pump standard, ASME B31.3 provides guidelines for the design, materials, construction, and testing of piping systems, which are crucial to the proper operation of pumps in process plants.

## ASME PTC 8.2: Performance Test Code for Centrifugal Pumps

This performance test code specifies the procedures and methods for conducting accurate performance tests on centrifugal pumps. It ensures consistent results across different testing facilities.

## IEC 60034: Rotating Electrical Machines

This standard defines the design and performance requirements for motors, including those used to drive centrifugal pumps. It ensures that motors meet efficiency and performance criteria to operate reliably under different conditions.

##  IEC 60529: Degrees of Protection Provided by Enclosures (IP Code)

This standard specifies the protection levels (IP ratings) for enclosures around electrical components, including motors used in pump systems. It ensures the safe operation of pumps in different environmental conditions (dust, water, etc.).

## EN 733 (DIN 24255): Centrifugal Pumps – Class I (End-Suction Pumps)

This European standard specifies the design and dimensions of end-suction centrifugal pumps. It is widely used across Europe for general-purpose applications in water supply, heating, and industrial systems.

## JIS B8301: Centrifugal Pumps (Japanese Industrial Standard)

The JIS B8301 standard outlines the design, materials, and testing requirements for centrifugal pumps in Japan. It is similar to ISO and ANSI standards but is specific to the Japanese market.
