# FMEA 10 steps

## Basic conception

* DVP&R: Design Validation and Product Review
* APQP
* AIAG-VDA
  * System Analsys
    * Planning and preparation
    * Structrue analysis
    * Function analysis
  * Failure Analysis and Risk Management
    * Failure analysis
    * Risk analysis
    * Optimisation
  * Record Documentation
* FMEA-MSR : Monitor & System Response FMEA
* AP : action priority
* DFMEA is to identify the weakpoint of the products.
  * the factor that affect the reliability
  * the factor that affect the performance
    * Identify the function
    * Identify the input --> parts feature-->output
  * the factor that affect the safety
  * the factor that affect the quality
  * the factor that affect the cost
    * Currency used
    * Raw material/material
    * Production process
    * Package/logistic, in & out
    * Markup, profit, patent, management cost
    * Transport, terms
    * Tools, the purchasing, modify, reload, etc
  * the factor that affect the environment
  * the factor that affect the customer
  * the factor that affect the customer satisfaction
  * the factor that affect the customer loyalty
  * the factor that affect the mountability/serviceability/function relization
* The cause could be
  * Material is not selected right
  * The process is not selected right
  * Too big/small tolerance
  * Not environment friendly
* PFMEA is to identify the weakpoint of the process.

## 5T Method

### 1. FMEA InTent : Why do we conduct the FMEA analysis?

### 2. FMEA Timing : When should we do it?

### 3. FMEA Team : Who should be part of the team?

### 4. FMEA Task : Where task should we do?

1. FMEA scope definition
2. FMEA structure analysis
3. Function analysis
4. Failure analysis
5. Risk analysis
6. Optimisation
7. Record documentation

### 5. FMEA Tool : How to conduct an analysis?



## 10 Steps

## 0. Establish Ground Rules

* Define the scales for Severity， Occurrence and Detection
* Document assumption
* Define acceptable risk levels

## Group A  Risk identification

### 1. Define your _**system or process**_ to be analysied

* Use system block diagram for DFMEA
  * Interface
  * Relationship between the different aspects of your design
* use flow diagram for PFMEA

### 2. Identify the potential failure modes for the product or process

* Start with design drawings (Robust design)
  * conception design
  * parameter design
  * tolerance design
* Identify the feature that if they were out of specification, would it impact the functionality of the product?
* Output detection testing method.

## Group B Risk analysis

* Causes --> Failure mode ---> Effect

### 3. Determine the potential effects of the failure mode on the system or customer

* Effect is the impact on the end user or customer.

### 4. Estimate the severity for each failure mode based on its effect

* Severity is a measure of the degree to which the end user is effected（impacted）by the potential failure mode being analyzed.

### 5. Determin the potential causes for each failure mode

The 8M's are all potential causes of a failure mode:

1. **Man** - how do the human interactions intruduce potential failure
2. **Machine** -How can your equipment or machines fail in a way that would result in a failure
3. **Method** - What written procedures do you have in place and how might they result in a failure.
4. **Material** - The is the one exception to most PFMEA's and DFMEA's...
5. **Mother Nature** - How might your production evironment contribute to a failure mode
6. **Measurement** -How might measurement techniques or equipment introduce failure.
7. **Management** - what are the attitudes & priorities of management that might result in a failure.
8. **Maintenance** - How might of maintenance & calibration activities introduct failures failure.

### 6. Estimate the likelihood of the occurrence for each failure mode & cause



### 7. Determine the controls around that failure mode and root cause

8 Control plan

### 8. Estimate your detection level for each failure mode, cause & effect

* By testing or certification.

### 9. Calculate the Risk Priority Number (RPN) for each failure mode

* RPN = Severity x Occurrence x Detection

## Group C Risk evaluation & risk control

### 10. Take corrective action to reduce/mitigate or eliminate risk

### 11. Identify the CTQ per VOC
